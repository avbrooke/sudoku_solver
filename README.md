# Welcome to the Sudoku Solver! 

_(this project is still a work in progress)_

* This sudoku solver was inspired by my love for sudoku. I wanted to build something that could help me out when I get really stuck on a puzzle.
* This project is deepening my understanding of backtracking algorithms, recursion and data structures.
