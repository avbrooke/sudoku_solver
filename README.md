# Welcome to the Sudoku SolverðŸ§©

_(this project is still a work in progress)_

This project implements a Sudoku puzzle solver in Python.
It uses backtracking recursion to efficiently fill in a Sudoku board.

## How It Works âœ¨

Empty spaces are represented by 0.
The algorithm recursively tries numbers 1-9 in empty cells.
It uses a validator function to ensure Sudoku rules are not violated:
Each row must contain the numbers 1â€“9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the numbers 1â€“9 without repetition.
Each 3Ã—3 box must contain the numbers 1â€“9 without repetition.
If a number fits, it moves forward; if not, it backtracks and tries the next number.

## Files ðŸ“„

solver(b) â†’ Solves the Sudoku board recursively using backtracking.
validator(b, pos, n) â†’ Checks if placing a number n at pos is valid.
find_empty(b) â†’ Finds the next empty spot (where 0 is found).
print_board(b) â†’ Nicely prints the board with 3Ã—3 box separations.
pprint â†’ Pretty-prints the final solved board after solving.
